### Video chat with drawing/writing with a single student professor and classroom viewing by Mike Hamilton, Colin Maher, Vikram Melkote

## About

A single site page where users can connect to a professor's room and queue up in the order they arrived in the room.

site layout: professor's camera is visible in one part of the part at all times. A single student's camera is next to the professor's at any given time, and the professor / student can close the chat so that the student's camera is no longer visible to the room and they are moved the the back of the queue. They are removed from this queue if they disconnect from the server. The rest of the page is a canvas visible to the room which the professor can write on in one color and the student who's camera is visible can write on in another color.
